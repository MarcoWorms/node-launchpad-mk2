# launchpad-mk2

A node module for interacting with the Launchpad MK2 and Launchpad Pro. Except that it doesn't really work with the MK2 at the moment. Sorry.

If you're looking for a module to interact with the original Launchpad or Launchpad S, check [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/midi-launchpad).

# VERSION 2.0.0 HAS MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES

The entire module has been rewritten to be more modern and use ES6 features. The new API will be documented sometime in the future.
